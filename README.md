# Percival-tests

Implementation of numerical tests for the augmented Lagrangian solver Percival from [Percival.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/Percival.jl).

Here, in [runcutest.jl](https://github.com/CiDAMO/Percival-tests/blob/master/runcutest.jl) you can run tests with problems of a CUTEst collection.
